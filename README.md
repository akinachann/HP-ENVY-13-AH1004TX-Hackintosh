## What NOT works

### There will be a kernel panic from time to time, especially after boot/reboot. Here is short for the log

> panic(cpu 0 caller 0xffffff8009b856a2): nvme: "3rd party NVMe controller. PCI link down. Delete IO submission queue. fBuiltIn=1 MODEL=INTEL SSDPEKKF360G7H FW=HP01 CSTS=0xffffffff US[1]=0x0 US[0]=0x227 VID=0xffff DID=0xffff CRITICAL_WARNING=0x0.\n" @IONVMeController.cpp:6090


It means that the panic should be linked to a NVMe SSD, I cannot find usefull information on the net.

### Only the two rear speakers work
 solution: you can find a way here https://github.com/dkoluris/HP-ENVY-13-AH0002-OpenCore
